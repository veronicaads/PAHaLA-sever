# Passport-Google-AuthCode

[Passport](http://passportjs.org/) strategy for authenticating with [Google](http://www.google.com/)
one time authorization code using the OAuth 2.0 API.

This module lets you authenticate using Google in your Node.js applications.
By plugging into Passport, Google authentication can be easily and
unobtrusively integrated into any application or framework that supports
[Connect](http://www.senchalabs.org/connect/)-style middleware, including
[Express](http://expressjs.com/).

## Installation

    $ npm install passport-google-authcode

## Usage

#### Require Strategy

Require the `passport-google-authcode` Strategy along with `passport`

```js
var passport = require('passport');
var GoogleAuthCodeStrategy = require('passport-google-authcode').Strategy;
```

#### Configure Strategy

The Google authentication strategy authenticates users using a Google
account and OAuth 2.0 tokens.  The strategy requires a `verify` callback, which
accepts these credentials and calls `done` providing a user, as well as
`options` specifying a app ID and app secret.

```js
passport.use(new GoogleAuthCodeStrategy({
    clientID: GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID,
    clientSecret: GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET
  },
  function(accessToken, refreshToken, profile, done) {
    User.findOrCreate({ googleId: profile.id }, function (err, user) {
      return done(err, user);
    });
  }
));
```

#### Authenticate Requests

Use `passport.authenticate()`, specifying the `'google-authcode'` strategy, to authenticate requests.

```js
app.post('/auth/google/authcode',
  passport.authenticate('google-authcode'),
  function (req, res) {
    // do something with req.user
    res.send(req.user? 200 : 401);
  }
);
```

The post request to this route should include a JSON object with the key `code` set to the one time authorization code you receive from google.
